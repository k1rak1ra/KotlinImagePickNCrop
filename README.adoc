= KotlinImagePickNCrop

Reconstructed source code for https://github.com/Chaintech-Network/CMP-image-pick-n-crop, due to their refusal to release their source despite claiming it is MIT-licensed


Added image picker support for wasmJs (Maybe if the original code was actually released publicly, I could've just contributed to it directly instead!)
